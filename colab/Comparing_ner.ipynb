Six weeks ago she was diogosed with A.T.C thyriod cancer. This is a rare and very fast growing cancer. She is currently in the end stage at Hershey Medical Center. Her five children, 19 being the youngest lost their father 3 years ago to cancer. They are very much in need of prayers and help for all the unexpected expenses to come. Any donation you can afford will be greatly appreciated as her children have been through enough hardship over the past few years. Thank you for all you contributions.  \n","# '''\n","# ]\n","\n","# input_list = [\n","# '''\n","# \"We had just finished eating lunch and Judah and Eloise were playing upstairs for a few minutes before I was going to go up and put them to bed for a nap. I heard a noise and went upstairs to investigate. I found Eloise looking out my bedroom window and the screen missing. I looked down to see Judah laying just below the second step, unconscious. As quickly as I could, I ran down stairs and onto the back patio where Judah came to and began crying and I called 911. A neighbor I've never even met came outside, saw the commotion, and jumped the fence with his army medic kit and went about stabilizing Judah, while I went to get Ellie who was still standing in the upstairs window crying. The paramedics arrived within minutes, checked his vitals, cut his shirt off, and got him on a board to transfer him via ambulance to Mary Bridge.  Friends. God is SO SO good. Yes, he fell out of a window. Yes, he landed on his head on pavement and fractured his skull. But it could have been SO much worse. He was less than an inch from that bottom step. I don't even want to think about what his injuries would have been had he landed on the steps instead. It is nothing short of a miracle that his injuries are not more extensive.  Why do bad things happen? So that His glory, His grace and mercy, can be made known. So that we can better see the work of His hands. So that we press into Him more than we knew we could. I am SO beyond thankful for His careful watch on my son and our family and the way He has taken care of us through this trauma. Your prayers, words of encouragement, messages, etc have all been a part of that. Thank you.  ‚ù§Ô∏è \" My brother is a full time working father while he wife Sam stays home with their 3  kids. We are so very grateful my nephew is alive and without injuries he could have sustained. Medical bills are coming their way that are unxpected and plenty for a family with one income.

The woman in the picture of this campaign is Amanda Somers. She is a 29 year old mother of an 8 year old little girl. Amanda is a bright, happy, caring, selfless person.  4 years ago she was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism and Graves Disease. If you are not familiar with these they are Auto Immune Diseases that are debilitating in many ways. She is hospitalized often, she is not able to work anymore, can't partake in any type of physical activities, is losing weight daily, most of her hair has fallen out,  is on a liquid diet, has severe insomnia, and her throat is so swollen that it makes it hard for her to breathe or swallow and  she is now taking 18 pills a day to help with all of her symptoms but it isnt working as much as the doctors had hoped for. About 4 months ago she had a mini stroke which caused her face to be partially paralyzed. Her heart is and has been beating out of control, blood pressure is extremely high which creates more of a problem on its own.  It has taken 3 years for her to get cardiac clearance to have this upcoming surgery. Her Endocrinologist and the Cardiac Surgeon are in agreement that without this surgery she could lose her life at a very young age. She  will still have permanent heart damage because it has taken so long to get the approval. The cost of the operation is just about $5000. ....  and approximately 35 days away...with her being unable to work and already being financially strapped with other medical expenses I'm hoping that with alot of outside help we can all make this surgery happen for her and so she can get back to living her life as a woking person and mother. She didn't want to ask for help so I thought the least I could do was ask myself. Even if all you can donate is $1.00 it is beyond appreciated. Thank You All!! Sincerely, Randy Pimentel\n","# '''              \n","# ]\n","\n","# input_list = [\n","# '''\n","# We are a hard working family. We were recently shocked with news of my husband Jose Gutierrez being diagnosed with A.M.L Leukemia. It has been a roller coaster of what if's? This last week has been hard on him and our family as we try to look for help and deal with everything the Doctors are telling me. I must confess that asking for donations it is hard to do because we have always worked for everything we need for us and our kids. So here I am asking for your kindness to help us by donating $1, $5 or if you are blessed to help us with more we will greatly appreciated it!! We can not afford to pay the hospital bills and he doesn't meet the criteria needed for Medicaid. He was told that he will not be able to work and even if the chemotherapy works he will not be able to work for a long period of time. He is now fighting for his life! I ask for your prayers for him and my family. I understand if you can't help with money. If I can please ask for  prayers for him to be cure. I would like to say thank you so much from my heart.  thank you for helping me save my husband by  getting  the treatments he needs and pay for his hospital bills and his care that he will need once he is out of the hospital.\n","# '''\n","# ]\n","\n","# input_list = [\n","\n","# \"My daughter and I are Midwesterners, cornfields and hardworking people, and it was a wonderful place to raise her and her sister. Graudating from college she set out on a road trip to experience the western wilderness and fell in love with the mountains. She settled into a small town in Idaho for over 14 years, working at the local health clinic while being a volunteer EMT. Seven years later, she met her beloved partner Tony. Tony had been coming to Stanley since he was 18 years old and was every mountain girls dream. He was a skier, coaching Olympic hopefuls and having fun in the backcountry. Tony was also a skilled and respected fly fisherman when he wasn‚Äôt working. Tony convinced Raechel of his intentions and they were married two years later in the spring, in a field of wildflowers, looking over the grand Rocky Mountains with friends and family. Two and a half years later they were blessed with my grand-daughter Sadie. Now, this family wants nothing more than to be together this day and every day. Raechel suffers from health complications and after great consideration, they decided to move from their beloved mountain home to a more populated place where Sadie could go to school and Raechel could get fresh produce in a much lower elevation. Sadie started kindergarten and Raechels health improved greatly. After a year of moving to their new location, Raechel went back to school, being accepted into a graduate program at a local Christian College. They saved enough money to buy a house in their new home state of Oregon, yet, the same week they closed on their house tony was diagnosed with stage 2 Ewing Sarcoma which is a rare form of cancer. The tumor is in the right forearm of his ulna bone and extending into the soft tissue. The cancer is considered localized which is good news but it is also very aggressive and fast growing therefore the treatment for this cancer is extremely aggressive. It requires hospitalization two times a month for high risk chemotherapy. He has a three day hospitalization, followed by a 5 day hospitalization, 12 days later. This cycle will continue until late November when they will order more imaging to determine how the cancer has responded to treatment. Tony will undergo surgery for removal of the tumor and his ulna bone which they intend to replace with a cadaver bone. After surgery he will resume the chemotherapy cycles until the end of March. Due to the severity of the treatment for this cancer, Tony will no longer be able to work for at least a year And will be rendered virtually disabled. Their financial needs are going to be for transportation, cost of living and medical. Driving over an hour, one way, to and from treatment and back and forth while he is hospitalized. Additional trips in between chemo treatment will also be necessary.  Fighting cancer is our number one priority.   We are all still working on being humble when it comes to asking and accepting help We appreciate your support and words of hope and encouragement. Thank you for visiting. We send out our greatest appreciation for all your help, love and prayers!!!\"\n","# ]\n","\n","# input_list = [\n","# \"Our son Tyler Zens was diagnosed with Necrotizing Fasciitis (a rare bacterial infection)  last night, underwent surgery to remove the dead tissue in his leg and spent the night in ICU.
